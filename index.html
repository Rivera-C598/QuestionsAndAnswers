                What was there before remains a mystery. Some scientists think out
                Universe began as a 'bubble',
                which split off from another universe! Others think that in the
                begginning, all the matter in the Universe was squeezed
                into a tiny, incredibly hot, incredibly massive ball. When the
                ball began to get bigger, like a balloon being blown up, all the
                matter in the Universe started to explode outwards.

            These forces are gravity, electromagnetism, and two forms of

            Earth in orbit around the Sun. The more matter a body has, the

                            but these units are too small to be useful in space. 
                            Scientists measure the Universe in light-years and parsecs. 
                            Light is the fastest thing in the Universe, 
                            so by measuring in light-years scientists are able to get a better idea of such great distances. 
                            A light-year is the distance that light travels in one year - about ten million million km. 
                            A light-year is roughly 3.25 parsecs. 
                            Light from even the closest stars takes years to reach us. 
                            The nearest star is over four light years away, 
                            so this means that when astronomers look at it through a telescope, 
                            they are actually looking back into the past - seeing the star as it was four years ago. 
                            Light from the most distant galaxies takes about 10,000 million years to reach us.
